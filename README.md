# FastAIClimbingStyleClassification
### Overview
This is a "homework" project for the first lesson of the ![https://course19.fast.ai/](FastAI) course featuring image classification problem. I am a big fan of rock climbing, so I decided to train my ML model to differentiate between five different styles of climbing:
1) Outdoor bouldering
