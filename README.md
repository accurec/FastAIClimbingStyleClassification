# FastAIClimbingStyleClassification
### Overview
This is a "homework" project for the first lesson of the [FastAI](https://course19.fast.ai/) course featuring image classification problem. I am a big fan of rock climbing, so I decided to train my ML model to differentiate between five different styles of climbing:

| Indoor climbing  | Outdoor climbing |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bouldering\ ![Indoor bouldering](./Readme_files/Climbing_examples/indoor_bouldering.jpg) | Bouldering\ ![Outdoor bouldering](./Readme_files/Climbing_examples/outdoor_bouldering.jpg) |
| Sport climbing | Sport climbing |
| | Trad climbing |

1) __Outdoor bouldering__

2) __Outdoor sport climbing__

3) __Outdoor trad climbing__

5) __Indoor sport climbing__

As you can see the indoor climbing is much different looking than the outdoor climbing. So at least that would be an easy classification task. However, distinguishing between different styles within these two categories could be tricky. For the indoor climbing ........ So let's see what is going to happen.
